Kalos Eats is an Android application that works similarly to TheFork.
<br>In the app, you can find several establishments, whether them being restaurants or bars or coffee shops.
<br> On the website, the establishment owner can apply for the app by delivering some details of themselves and their establishment.
<br>After the application has been done, there will have to be checked by the admin all the information, and update the app.

# How this project started?
I started to develop this app when I was in my final year studying mandatory school, and I needed to develop a project. 

I chose to do an app and a website because I was confident in my skills and also because I still couldn't decide if I wanted to code on web or mobile development. 

# Features
On the website, you'll find:
- Registration Form, for your establishment
- Explanation for the app
- List of advantages the app can deliver to your establishment

On the app, you'll find:
- List of several other establishments
- Location of other establishments
- Status of the establishment (To see what time it's open, and when it closes)

# Future implementations
I'm also looking to add:
- Translation option
- Some way to check if the establishment is open by the current time on the phone
- A search bar for the establishments
- In-depth screen for every establishment, with personal information
- The products that are sold on the establishment
- A screen to only show the products
- A search bar for the products
- A sorter for the price of the products
- A sorter for the distance of the establishments
